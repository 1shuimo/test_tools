Since the processes of electron scattering and deceleration and those of  \\mathbf{X} -ray generation will be virtually the same in both elements, the   \\phi(\\rho z) curves for ﬁlm and substrate elements will be almost identical. As a result, either of them could be used to calculate the generated and emitted intensities from ﬁlm and substrate elements by partial integration between the appropriate limits. This simple approximation is known to work well as long as the difference in atomic number between ﬁlm and substrate element does not exceed, say, 3–4 units. With increasing difference in atomic number the difference in electron scattering properties between ﬁlm and substrate elements becomes noticeable and the \\mathbf{X} -ray production in the ﬁlm can be inﬂuenced substan- tially. If the substrate element is heavier, then the  \\mathbf{X} -ray production in the ﬁlm will be increased, and vice versa.

Besides, there appears to be a strong bias towards ﬁlms deposited on Si substrates, for obvious rea- sons. We therefore decided to set up large and systematic databases which contain measurements on a wide vari- ety of ﬁlm thicknesses of several elements, deposited on a wide range of substrates, ranging from Be to Bi, and measured over a wide range of accelerating voltages.

Since there is no strict ‘end’ to a Gaussian curve, this presents something of a problem. In a previous publication,   where the surface-centered Gaussian model 1   was used, this was solved by taking  2.5/\\alpha_{\\mathrm{final}}^{i}   for each speciﬁc element as a convenient measure, since this ratio was found to represent the depth at which the original surface-centered Gaussian had dropped to less than  0.2\\%  of its ﬁctitious starting value   \\gamma . In the double Gaussian model,   \\alpha  operates in the right-hand (descending) branch only; it lies at hand, therefore, to suppose that the position   \\rho z_{\\mathrm{m}} , at which the maximum in   \\phi(\\rho z) occurs, has to be added to  2.5/\\alpha_{\\mathrm{final}}^{i} in order to ﬁnd the ‘end’ of the \\phi(\\rho z) curve. However, the ﬁnal   \\alpha^{i}   value is not known  a priori , because it has yet to be calculated from the \\alpha_{\\mathrm{b,f}}^{i}   and   \\alpha_{\\mathrm{b,s}}^{i}   values, using weighting laws that are supposed to weight the various contributions over the relevant mass depth region down to \\pmb{R}_{x} . Since R_{x}  is not known either, it is necessary to start an iterative procedure to arrive at the ﬁnal   \\alpha  value and, hence, R_{x} . The ﬁrst (crude) estimate for   \\pmb{R}_{x}  is obtained by averaging the constituent   (\\rho z_{\\mathrm{m}}^{i}+2.5/\\alpha^{i})   C values in the bulk of the ﬁlm and the substrate, and this mean value can then be used to generate a ﬁrst estimate for R_{x} . Next, a more accurate weighting procedure is started, in which the weight  (\\pmb{p})  of each contribution as a function of mass depth  (\\rho z)  is described by a fourth-degree polynomial:"

The results must be regarded as excellent, certainly if one takes into consideration that in a number of cases (which have still been included in the ﬁnal database) the experimen- tal conditions for thin-ﬁlm analysis are not suitable at all. Examples of these cases are when the accelerating volt- age for a given ﬁlm thickness is simply too low, so that the   \\phi(\\rho z) curve for the ﬁlm element barely touches on the substrate. It is evident that the results could become very much better if such cases were eliminated from the database."

Figure 6 shows the results obtained for the silicon (top) and titanium (bottom) substrates, and Fig. 7 gives similar results for the much heavier germanium (top) and molybdenum (bottom) substrates. Again, it appears evident that satisfactory agreement is obtained between calculations and measurements, with very few excep- tions. The latter are connected again with those cases where the conditions for thin-ﬁlm analysis are unsuit- able: when the accelerating voltage for the ﬁlm thick- ness at hand is low and the   \\phi(\\rho z) curve hardly extends into the substrate. The results of the overall statistical analysis for the substrate elements, similar to the one performed before for the ﬁlm element, are shown in Fig. 8. After the elimination of the results obtained under totally unsuitable experimental conditions, most satisfac- tory mean   k^{\\prime}/k  (1.0125) and r.m.s. values  (3.6670\\%)  are obtained.

The only noticeable deviations can be found in cases where the conditions are not suitable: low accelerating voltage, heavy substrate, e.g. W, and thick ﬁlm (Fig. 4, bottom). If such results were to be excluded from the histogram in Fig. 5, then, of course, very much improved results could be obtained."

Obviously, it can be difﬁcult enough to measure k  ratios which differ only very slightly from unity. This observation, in conjunction with the fact that the slightest deviation in the substrate k  ratio can produce a large deviation in the mass thickness of the ﬁlm if the program is run the other way around, can make it somewhat tricky to use the measured   k ratio of the substrate element exclusively in order to ﬁnd the mass thickness of the ﬁlm. In all cases much more weight should be assigned to the signals emitted by the ﬁlm elements; after all, the emitted ﬁlm sig- nals are more or less directly proportional to the ﬁlm thickness."
